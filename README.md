WBD Website Development For Stem Corpus Code Challenge

## Start up instructions

After cloning repo run npm install followed by npm run. <br/>
Dependancies include react-router-dom, react-icons, and node modules

## Accomplishing the Task

If I'm being honest I'm quite dissapointed in the way I went about implementing and accomlishing this task. With such limited time between working and this challenge many shortcuts were taken to get some sort of MVP up and running. As a result of this, html templates were not used, components were not used to the fullest potential. That is to say many components do not utalize state or are very resuable (textBox component prime example). <br/>

With that being said I did try to implement the use of components and structure my files in such a way to make it easy to navigate and reuse components as much as I could while learning during the process.

As far a responsiveness goes there is much to be desired as, even resizing the window of the application will throw off many of the html elements and react components. This is something, along with the items stated above that will be fixed after this challenge has concluded.

You'll notice there are some pages that are empty. This is because I didn't have enough time at the end of the project to successfully learn to create and implement forms that users can interact with. You'll see in ../../components/interactable/formComponents my unfinished work at the time of submission.

## Thank You!

I'd just like to say thanks for your time, consideration and giving me the opprotunity to learn the skills needed to complete a task like this code challenge. It's given me valuable insight on what areas I lack in React and developing an application.
